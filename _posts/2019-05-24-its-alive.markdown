Getting docker for desktop working in WSL is as easy as exposing the 
docker socket over tcp and setting `DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375`.

However, when trying to use the `docker_image` module in Ansible, the following error
appeared: 

```
failed: [localhost] (item=ansible) => {
    "ansible_loop_var": "item", 
    "changed": false, 
    "item": "ansible", 
    "msg": "Error pushing image <image name>: docker-credential-desktop not 
            installed or not available in PATH"
}
```

Turs out there is no `docker-credential-desktop` available by default. At least with the
lastest docker for desktop. So let's create our own:

<figure>
  <figcaption>/usr/local/bin/docker-credential-desktop</figcaption>

{% highlight bash %}
#!/bin/bash

"/mnt/c/Program Files/Docker/Docker/Resources/bin/docker-credential-desktop.exe" $@
{% endhighlight %}

</figure>

You might obviously need to tweak the path depending on your installation. 
Enjoy all the `docker_image` goodness.
